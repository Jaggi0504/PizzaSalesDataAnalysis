#PizzaSalesDataAnalysis

In this project, I did some analysis on the data of a pizza store and displayed it using Power BI.
1. Showed two pages in the report "Home" and "Best/Worst Sellers" and used a page navigator to navigate through the pages.
2. Used 'mesaure' of Power BI to extract KPIs.
3. Used a slicer to display data of a particular pizza category.

On Home page:
1. Displayed KPIs like Total Revenue, Total Orders, Total Pizzas Sold, Average Pizzas Per Order, Average Order Value.
2. Total revenue by pizza category.
3. Total revenue by pizza size.
4. Total pizzas sold by pizza category.
5. Total orders by day.
6. Total orders by month.

On Best/Worst Sellers page:
1. KPIs
2. Top and Bottom 5 pizzas by revenue.
3. To and Bottom 5 pizzas by quantity sold.
4. Top and Bottom 5 pizzas by total orders.

Insights about the data:
1. The store received maximum orders on Friday.
2. July was the busiest month with total of 1935 orders and January was the second highest with 1845.
3. All the categories performed quite well in revenue. Classic pizza contributed ~27% of revenue and performed the best.
4. The Large sized pizza had the maximum revenue and XL only contributed ~1.7% of the total revenue (the worst).
5. The store owner has to focus on Bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, quantities sold, and total orders.
